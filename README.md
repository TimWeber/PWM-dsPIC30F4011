The aim of this was to be able to drive an LED using PWM, a dsPIC30F4011 and the MPLAB X IDE for my Microcontroller Application Group Lab (MAGL) module at university.

The skills gained in from this project went on to be drive the motors within small robot built to complete in a micromouse-style challenge.
